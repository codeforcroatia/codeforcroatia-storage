# Europe we Want

## About the Hackathon Europe we Want

This Fall, a new set of commissioner-candidates will be nominated by EU governments to become members of the new EU Commission. Many of them will be practically unknown to the EU public.

The only hurdle they will have to cross is the vetting process by the European Parliament which will take place in September and October.

If approved, these candidates will take over key roles that can steer the EU policy for the next five years.

This hackathon will be an opportunity to come together to explore the profiles of these new commissioners and their overall suitability for their portfolio.

There are many questions we can explore, including:

* Do the [candidates](https://talk.tttp.eu/tags/candidates) have any conflicts of interest?
* What are their stances on key issues (for instance, migration, climate action, tax avoidance)?
* What is their background?

These are just a few examples. We will surely find new stories, deeper analysis and maybe even create new projects. Hopefully this will also contribute to a deeper scrutiny of the new EU Commission.

To make the most of our hackathon, let’s **use this forum to share ideas of what you would want to do, dataset you have or start collecting articles about the candidates**.

Between now and the hackathon, can you research the commissioners? Can you **look for articles and information, especially news in locale languages** and post them as replies to the [candidates topic](https://talk.tttp.eu/tags/candidates)?

Practical info: Bring your laptops and your curiosity, we will provide the space (with two gardens for breaks), food and drink. We have limited places and will try to balance the various skills needed to make great teams, so the sooner your register, the most likely you can join.

### Code for Croatia satellite event: Imamo pravo znati tko su kandidati za novi sastav Europske komisije

Pozivamo vas da u subotu, 7.9. sudjelujete u mini-hackathonu kandidata za Europske komisije.

Tijekom jeseni zemlje članice EU nominirat će svoje kandidate za novi sastav Europske komisije. Na inicijativu koalicijskog saveza [AlterEU](https://www.alter-eu.org/who-we-are), o njima bi željeli prikupiti što je moguće više relevantnih podataka kako bi na vrijeme otkrili jesu li neki među njima u sukobu interesa, povezani s korporacijama ili lobistima.

Formular za prijavu na hakhaton potražite na linku https://framaforms.org/hack-the-new-eu-commission-07-september-1563287919, a u polje organizacije unesite Code for Croatia.

Organizatori najavljuju kako će pokušati osigurati virtualnu vezu za nekolicinu sudionika pa bismo se 7.9. u vremenu od 10 do 23 sata svi prijavljeni skupili u prostoru Gonga u Zagrebu.
